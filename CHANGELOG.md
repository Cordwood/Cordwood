Cordwood is born! {changelog-added-secondary changelog-margin-top}
==========================================

After about two days of work, Cordwood has been brought into life!

Developed by the lovely team of two, [Beefers](gh:Beefers) and [Alyxia](gh:lexisother), Cordwood is a client mod for Hummus loosely based off of [Cumcord for Discord](srht:~creatable/Cumcord).

At the moment, we have:

* **Webpack tools:** from `findByDisplayName` to `findByProps`, the basic tools to find Webpack modules are all here.
* **A patcher** brought to you by [Creatable](gh:cr3atable) and [Yellowsink](gh:Yellowsink), which can be found [here](gh:Cumcord/spitroast).
* **An epic changelog**. Yeah, we're egotistical like that.

Furthermore, thanks to [Ducko](gh:CanadaHonk) for helping with displaying this very changelog. :)

We're cooking up much more exciting features like **plugins**, **themes**, and some epic UI.

You can track development [here](gh:Cordwood/Cordwood), on our cozy little GitHub repo.

Thanks for reading the first changelog, and we hope you enjoy Cordwood!
